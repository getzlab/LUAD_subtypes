This repository contains the scripts used for LUAD expression subtype analysis in the publication:

High-resolution lung adenocarcinoma expression subtypes identify tumors with dependencies on MET, CDK4, CDK6, and PD-L1

[Note] Our TCGA LUAD expression subtypes can be projected to the expression dataset of interest with the projection code available in the /src/00 Subtype projection codes/. The normalized H matrix (H.Bayes.new.norm) contains the subtype membership probability of each sample in the expression dataset of interest.
